%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   TWITTER BOT  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Off recently, It was getig awfully cold in Baltimore. I forgot my jacket at home and was checking temperatures do decide on a time to leave the university and walking back home. So, in the meanwhile, I wrote a bot which scrapes google.com for baltimore temperatures and tweets it under the handle @charmcitytemp. For a while, I left it running on crontab, but got it out later. In anycase, its a pretty trivial bot I made in about half and hour"""

tempscrapper.py scrapes google for the current  temperature.
twitter_bot.py simply tweets it.
